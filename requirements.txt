    REQUIREMENTS

    - As I've created an interface in Kivy, Kivy is required to run the code.


    IF I HAD MORE TIME...

    - Error handling so that the application doesn't crash when user input is the wrong type, for example if
    a string is the input instead of an int as the age in create_person.

    - Bigger chatbox_history_lbl, so that the user won't have to scroll so much

    - Initially, my plan was to be more ambitious, but I realised I didn't have enough time. The functionality
    I would add is:
        -> Create a family
        -> Create several people and add them to the family
        -> Assign every family member relationships with the other members
        -> Pick the members in the dropdown menu, not just the roles like it is now
